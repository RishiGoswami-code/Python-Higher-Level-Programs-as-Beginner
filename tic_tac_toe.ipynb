    "1.Making A Nested Matrix For Board\n",
    "The board is created as a 3 rows using nested lists. Each cell is initially empty (represented by a space '\n",
    "').\n",
    "board = [[' ' for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)] {This format of nested loop was taught by prof. Pintu sir}\n",
    "2. Printing the Board\n",
    "Defined the print_board function to show the matrix in the tabular form not in the horizontal form.\n",
    "Logic: Iterate through each row of the board. And printed each row.\n",
    "3. Player Move Selection\n",
    "Logic:\n",
    "- this function takes two input one is pisotion which user want to fill and the coin or symbol which is\n",
    "specified for each players.\n",
    "- If the position matches the player's choice, update the cell with their mark ('X' or 'O'). {board[i][j]=coin}\n",
    "4. Players function\n",
    "Logic:\n",
    "Check if the decision of the player exists in the list of available matrix or not. If available, update the\n",
    "board and remove the position from the available list.\n",
    "If invalid, ask again to play the player.\n",
    "5. Checking Win Conditions\n",
    "The win_lose function determines if a player has won the game. It checks rows, columns, and diagonals\n",
    "to see if all cells in any line contain the same mark.\n",
    "Logic:\n",
    "- Check each row to see if all elements are the same as the player's coin or symbol.\n",
    "- Check each column similarly.\n",
    "- Check the two diagonals (main and anti-diagonal) for the same condition.\n",
    "6. Alternating Turns\n",
    "The play_game function alternates turns between Player 1 and Player 2.\n",
    "Logic:\n",
    "- Use a loop to alternate between Player 1 and Player 2 for up to 9 moves.\n",
    "- After each move, check for a winning condition using win_lose.\n",
    "- If a player wins, end the game and announce the winner."
